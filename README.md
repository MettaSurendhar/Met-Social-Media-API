# MET_SOCIAL_HANDLER
## Social Media API using Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL

### This API is built using Node.js, Express.js, Prisma, and PostgreSQL.

## File Structure

Our project is organized into several key directories:

1. **Controllers**: This directory contains the logic for handling requests and responses. It's where we define our app's behavior in response to user actions.

2. **Routes**: This directory is responsible for routing the app's requests to the correct controller functions.

3. **Models**: This directory contains the data models for our app. These models define the structure of our data and interact with the database.

4. **Utilities**: This directory contains various utility functions and helpers that are used throughout the app.

5. **Services**: This directory contains business logic, or code that isn't directly related to receiving requests and sending responses.

6. **app.js**: This is the main file that starts our server and contains the middleware for our app.

7. **server.js**: This file is responsible for setting up and starting our Express server.

8. **schema**: This directory contains the Prisma schema file, which defines our database schema and models.

I hope this gives you a clear understanding of our project's structure and the technologies used. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.
